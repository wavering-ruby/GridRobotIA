# Project's Objetive

The chosen theme to the realization of this project it's Navigation of a Robot, consisting guiding a robot inside a warehouse to carry packeges from origin (A) to the destiny (B), using the minitum time possible, seeing routes and deviating from collision.

## 1. Environment Modeling

The environment of the movimentation of the robot it's represented by a graph or a grid. Each cell of the grid or node of a graph represents one position of the space.

The obstacles is marked as inacessible cells or nodes.

You will see, that some algorithms are used in weight cases or non weight cases of a graph.

## 2. Definition of the Origin and Destiny

The robot starts on a initial point (initial node or cell) and needs to find a route to the objective point (final node or cell).

## 3. Costs Function
